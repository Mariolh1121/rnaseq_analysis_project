abstract = {To gain insight into how mutant huntingtin ({mHtt}) {CAG} repeat length modifies Huntington's disease ({HD}) pathogenesis, we profiled {mRNA} in over 600 brain and peripheral tissue samples from {HD} knock-in mice with increasing {CAG} repeat lengths. We found repeat length-dependent transcriptional signatures to be prominent in the striatum, less so in cortex, and minimal in the liver. Coexpression network analyses revealed 13 striatal and 5 cortical modules that correlated highly with {CAG} length and age, and that were preserved in {HD} models and sometimes in patients. Top striatal modules implicated {mHtt} {CAG} length and age in graded impairment in the expression of identity genes for striatal medium spiny neurons and in dysregulation of cyclic {AMP} signaling, cell death and protocadherin genes. We used proteomics to confirm 790 genes and 5 striatal modules with {CAG} length-dependent dysregulation at the protein level, and validated 22 striatal module genes as modifiers of {mHtt} toxicities in vivo.}
